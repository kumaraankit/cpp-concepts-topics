# STL

STL stands for Standard template library and it contains range of containers which like vectors, stacks,list, map ,set etc to store and manipulate data.

There are total 3 different types of containers in STL 

1. Sequential - a group of template classes used to store data elements (vectors, stack, queue)
2. Ordered - Ordered means the elements will come out sorted (Set, Map)
3. Unordered - Unordered means the elements will come out sorted (unordered Set, Unordered Map)
